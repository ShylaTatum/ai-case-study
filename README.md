## Advancements in medical research with AI and Machine Learning

##  Overview and Origin

### _Name of company:_
Insitro

### _When was the company incorporated?_ 
2018

### _Who are the founders of the company?_ 
Daphne Koller PH.D founded the company after deciding that machine learning could transform research and development of medical treatments. 

### _How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?_ 
Daphne Koller Ph.D was teaching machine learning at Stanford. She applied machine learning to drug research and development. She saw a need to utilize large data sets to increase the probability of creating the best formula of a drug or treatment to move forward in the development process. She wanted to develop targeted medicines at a lower cost and a higher acceptance rate of clinical trials by utilizing large data sets and machine learning. 

The stated purpose on the [Insitro Company Website](https://www.insitro.com):
>“...A dramatically different approach is needed – one enabled by data-driven predictions to advance high conviction insights and purposefully design treatments patients need.” It is clear the founder believes that data and data science will improve all aspects of research and development in the medical field. 

### _How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?_ 
The company has 19 investors, including Black Rock and Alexandria Venture Investments. Insito has raised $643 million in 3 rounds of investments. They also acquired assets through the acquisition of Haystack Sciences on Oct 22, 2020.

The current value is $2.5 Billion and appears on Forbes top 50 AI companies for 2024.

## Business Activities

### _What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?_
The company is using AI and machine learning to analyze human genes to make the development of new drugs and treatments faster and more affordable. By using the Ai they can reduce the possibility of being rejected by the FDA.they are utilizing large data sets to compare health and unhealthy genes to help isolate the mutations and streamline the creation of treatments targeting the unhealthy variations. 

The goal is to make research and development more cost efficient by using more data. By having data driven treatments the acceptance rate of a clinical trial should increase. By making a data driven treatment formula it is much less likely the company will lose funds due to a clinical trial that is rejected.

### _Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?_
The company looks to accelerate drug discovery and development for patients in need. Their current areas of research are genetic epilepsy, ALS, Solid tumors(oncology), and MASLD. 

### _What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)_
Insitro focused on specific disorders. There did not appear to be an overlap with the competitors investigated for this research. They also boast that they have gathered extremely large datasets, according to the founder they have access to hundreds of thousands of cases  through their partnerships. The other companies with similar research seem to still be in development. 

Insitro has successfully identified mutations in cells that return cells to a healthy state after an illness such as tuberous sclerosis complex. By identifying these genes that can be targeted treatments are able to advance through the development process and are showing promise. By having a lot of data and utilizing machine learning this could be identified and hasten the development while increasing the accuracy and likelihood of a positive outcome. 

### _Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing; you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)_
Insitro has an extensive database with hundreds of thousands of entries on solid tumors. The founder was a professor of machine learning at Stanford. They use large databases to identify the genes that are common in patients suffering from a particular illness. They are using machine learning and AI to identify the healthy version and an unhealthy version of the gene/genes responsible. Then they use this data to develop treatments that are focused on gene therapy to change the mutation that is causing the illness. It appears they are isolating the unhealthy cases and mapping their genomes and looking for commonalities; then comparing them with mapped genomes of individuals without the disorder to confirm if they have correctly identified the genes related to an illness. 
They are conducting test tube experiments on cells with and without the mutations to generate data for the AI to analyze in order to reformulate. It can then learn from the outcomes of many formulas at once.   

## Landscape

### _What Field is the company in?_
Medical, drug research and development. 

### _What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 to 10 years?_
Using machine learning in the development of drug formulas is seen as a trend and is expected to expand in the future as it can speed up the development process and increase accuracy. Previously the formula of a new drug was determined through a series of trial and error that used experts' best opinion on what to try. Now we can leverage large datasets to better determine the ratios; this generates a version based on data available for widespread testing faster. Basing it on data also drastically increases the probability that the formula will pass clinical trials. 

Large and small firms are starting to use this process. Johnson and Johnson have begun to utilize big data and machine learning in some of their development firms. The US appears to be leading this trend as so many biotech firms are based in the US. AI and machine learning are expected to be used more and more as they are already showing a cost saving by reducing development time and increasing the success rates of drug trials.  

### _What are the other major companies in this field?_
Interius Bio Therapeutics, Menten AI

Interius Bio Threapeutics:
Interius Bio Therapeutics is also using gene therapy to target diseases. They are looking at technology to grow new healthy cells to prevent the need for chemotherapy. They are using similar technology to cure cancers. Their treatments appear to still be in development and don’t appear to have metrics available. 

Menten AI:Mentions research is focused on peptides. They have successfully created the first protein designed on a quantum computer. Menton has used machine learning and computational modeling. They use simulators to conduct initial testing. 

### _Partnerships_
Insitro has partnerships with Biobank, Genomics England, TSC Alliance and Bristol Myers Squibb. This appears to be where they are getting their data. 

## Results

### _What has been the business impact of this company so far?_
Insitro has identified mutations that have caused epilepsy and by studying the same genes in healthy genomes they hope to develop better treatments. 
They have been successful in making partnerships to access more data and funding.
The company appears on the top 50 AI companies of 2024 and has won numerous awards.

Inestro is still researching and developing treatments. The research is showing great promise.
The current value is $2.5 Billion and has raised over 643 million in funding from investors.  

### _What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field used to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?_
The acceptance rate of new treatments from the FDA, and the reduction of development time and cost are the main considerations.
At this time they have had great success in their research by isolating genomes. This has led to many new investors to be able to develop the technology further.  

### _How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?_
Many of the competitors appear also to be in the development phase. However, Interius has made significant discoveries. Iterius has been able to prove progress by mapping genomes and identifying both healthy and unhealthy gene sequences. They have gained partnerships that have allowed them to be able to boast a robust dataset for research. They are achieving goals that are supporting their research. 

##  Recommendations

### _If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)_
I would advise them to expand their research and apply their technology to more genetic conditions. They already have an extensive database of human genomes.
 
In the future it may be entirely possible to collect all known genes that can have known medical issues so that all people can know what they are predisposed to and treat disorders before symptoms even manifest. This would require partnering with all groups who successfully identify an undesirable genetic pattern. This would allow preventative testing to identify issues before they manifest, and offer solutions.  

### _Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?_
Expanding into more areas would allow more areas to benefit and more people to get better help sooner. 
Being able to widely test and prevent disease would be a huge humanitarian benefit. Being the leader in these types of tests would position any company as a vital resource in healthcare. Healthy and unhealthy individuals would benefit from the screening and those needing treatment could get it before suffering from the manifestation of the symptoms. This would also be a great resource for doctors to shorten diagnosis time. This could benefit the insurance as screening and preventive treatments would be more cost effective in the long run. There would be tremendous benefit to a multitude of industries and patients as well.  The company would benefit by becoming an indispensable resource especially as the database included more and more genomes and synopsis. 

### _What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?_
The most efficient way to expand would be more partnerships to utilize existing data. 
Once the partnerships are established, a shared database would need to be built. There would have to be a way to easily share data, or just submit data if the model was not reciprocal. Once data is submitted there would need to be an automated quality control to ensure the data is clean and useful. Then it can be added to the main dataset that could be used for research comparing test results, training an AI Etc. A static dataset could then be created to house the known genomes and be offered as a research resource. Access to that resource could be offered as a service to others and utilized to analyze test results. 

### _Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?_
The database in the cloud allows for many users in many locations to add data securely. The interface would be designed to fit and making it easy is to reduce the possibility of errors. 
Automated quality control is to prevent bad formating or data being submitted that would undermine the validity of the rest of the data. If it allowed anything to be added the data could get cluttered with cases that are duplicates, or that have incorrect entries. The data would have to be of high quality for this to achieve the best results.
The static dataset is to allow for the testing to be straight forward. If you compare test results to live data that is changing constantly it takes more memory and opens the possibility to more errors. This could be updated on a schedule. By having a controlled dataset results can be consistent, use less memory and be faster.
